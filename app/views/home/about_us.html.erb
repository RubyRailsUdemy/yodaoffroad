      Welcome to Yoda Off-Road. My Great Grandfather used to own a mining claim in the Plumas National Forest in a town called Poker Flat. He used to take his son (my grandpa) and his kids up to this mining claim often. Though he never struck it rich it there was never a dull time. It was here that my Dad first fell in love with nature. Since I was a young kid he would take me on trips exploring the backroads of Northern California and Nevada. Over the years we have seen history with our own eyes. From fire lookouts, which in WWII were also used to spot enemy air craft, to the ghost town of Bodie. And lets not forget that 30 years after my Great Grandfather sold the claim in Poker Flat we went to explore the area and still to this day have found that his old mining claims are posted on the trees. It was on these trips that I, myself, fell in love with nature and exploring all that can be explored. For most kids when they turn 16 they want a car to be able to visit friends, work, and drive to school; however I simply wanted my own truck so I can explore history from the drivers seat instead of of being the co-pilot.

      My very first vehicle was a 1990 Toyota Pick-Up. Though it was old at the time about 17 years old (it was manufacture almost exactly 1 years before I was born) it was my escape into nature. It was then that I started to learn about vehicle maintenance and mods. Right away we began building it up to be self-sustaining off-road so that when we were on trails we left the smallest foot print possible. My second vehicle was purchased from my Dad and was a 2001 Toyota Tacoma. This vehicle he had already modified quite a lot and was more than proven as a worthy over landing rig. I had this vehicle for nearly 5 years before I needed something a little more economical to commute to work everyday. I’m sure you’ve heard about how keeping a lion in a cage increases its restlessness until it bursts free. Well in March of 2017 I finally had enough of the small commuter car set up and with the blessings of my amazing fiancee` purchased a 2017 Toyota Tacoma.

      Now I know what you’re saying.. “Toyota, Toyota, Toyota.” Well yea… The name of this site is YODA!!! off road. Now you’re thinking well Yoda… That’s from Star Wars.. unless you’ve never seen Star Wars and have no idea what I am talking about. For those folks that haven’t seen Star Wars please stop reading here and head over to Amazon or Vudu and rent/buy all 7 movies you will love them.. and if you don’t.. stop lying because you know deep down you loved em. Anyways back to why I’ve named this site Yoda Off-Road. Not only was it because of my love of Star Wars but it fits perfectly into the original name of Toyota Motor Corporation. Toyota was founded by Kiichiro Toyoda from Japan. Recently Akio Toyoda, Grandson of Kiichiro, made a statement that his name is on every vehicle. People were skeptical because the vehicles say Toyota not Toyoda. Later it was explained that Writing Toyoda in Japanese requires 10 brushstrokes while Toyota requires only 8. This may seem trivial however The Washington post quoted John R. Malott’s, from the State Department, explanation as follows “In the Japanese language 10 consts of two strokes crossed against each other depicting a + sign or even crossroads or an uncertain path. None of these are good omens for a company.” He further went on to explain this is a very Japanese way of thinking. Regardless of the reasons the company is named Toyota instead of Toyoda it works perfectly to fit in with my love of Star Wars.

      This site is dedicated to the adventures taken in the 2017 Toyota Tacoma by my Fiancee` and I as we explore what this great land has to offer. Of course you may see some trips taken prior to our new vehicle pop up here and there however you will easily see the difference when you see a silver 1st Generation Tacoma or the Old 1990’s Toyota Pickup in the pictures. I hope this site can be not only fun to look at but also informational. While modifications are made to the Tacoma I will write posts and post pictures to help explain why the modification was made. Just know if it has to do with me removing something chrome and painting or replacing it with something white or black it’s fuled by my hatred for chrome… Especially plastic chrome that Toyota is very fond of.
